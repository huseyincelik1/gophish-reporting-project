# GoPhish Reporting Project

This project is a **Social Engineering / Phishing Simulation** conducted as part of the **Cybersecurity Specialist Internship Program at Acunmedya AkademiQ**.

NOT: Bu proje, GoPhish ile gerçekleştirilen sosyal mühendislik testine ait verilerin toplanması, analiz edilmesi ve HTML formatında raporlanmasını içermektedir. 21 kişilik hedef grup üzerinde yapılan test sonucunda kullanıcı etkileşimleri (e-posta açma, bağlantıya tıklama, bilgi gönderme) analiz edilmiştir.

## 📌 Project Summary

The purpose of this project is to simulate a phishing attack scenario using **GoPhish**, a popular open-source phishing framework. This simulation includes the full lifecycle of a phishing campaign, from email delivery to data collection and reporting.

> **⚠️ Legal Disclaimer:**  
> This simulation was performed in a fully legal and controlled environment. Only one phishing email was sent and confirmed by my own personal backup email for demonstration and reporting purposes.  
> No real users or organizations were targeted.  
> The objective was strictly educational.
